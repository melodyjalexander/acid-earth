    <h2>Hi, nice to meet you.<br />No really, I'm glad you're here.</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a UX engineer based in Durham, North Carolina. I like designing
      digital experiences that spark joy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before transitioning into design and web development, I worked in
      contemporary art spaces and museums to develop and produce exhibitions,
      art fairs and community-centered programming.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a multidisciplinary designer, my projects may vary, but my process
      usually begins the same way. After a conversation (and lots of notes), I
      like to start with pencil, paper, a well curated playlist, and three
      beverages at my desk.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently unavailable for freelance work, but feel free to reach out
      for anything else including photos of my dog and digital happy hour
      invitations.
    </p>
