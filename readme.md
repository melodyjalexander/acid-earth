# Acid Earth

Acid Earth is a responsive website featuring bold, psychedelic images documenting natural phenomena and unique landscapes from around the world. This site utilizes images from public domain collections from around the internet.

The intent of this project was to create a blog style website that featured responsive design, semantic HTML, forms, and CSS styling.

This is an academic project designed and built while I was completing a UX Engineering Certification at Kenzie Academy.
